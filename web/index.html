  <p> Have you ever said to yourself &ldquo;Golly, I <strong>hate</strong>
    daylight savings time! &nbsp;Having my clock jump around makes me doubt
    the very <strong>continuity</strong> of the <em>space-time
    continuum</em>!&rdquo; Or maybe you said it to a co-worker? Or maybe you
    said it to somebody on the <strong>bus</strong>, after a long day at
    <strong>work</strong>?  Then this app is for you!  Have you ever started
    driving on a <strong>vacation</strong> and found your clock suddenly
    <strong>jump</strong> forward or backwards an <em>hour</em>?
    Disconcerting, isn&apos;t it? These <strong>arbitrary</strong> time zone
    changes could be a driving hazard! Well, this app is for you!  </p>

  <p> The Daylight Local Time Zone app displays time in <strong>your very
    own</strong> Local Time Zone. Install the app on your
    <strong>Android</strong> phone, or keep the web page open on your
    <strong>laptop</strong>, and your clock will continuously adjust itself
    to the timezone based on your current location.  No more
    <strong>discontinuities</strong>!</p>

  <p> &ldquo;But, Fred, what about adjusting time so there are more hours of
    <strong>daylight</strong> in the <strong>winter</strong>?&rdquo; I hear
    you say, quite clearly, as if you are standing right behind my
    <strong>left</strong> shoulder. This app solves that problem, too!  In
    the daylight local time zone, time is adjusted so that 6:00 AM is
    <strong>sunrise</strong> and 6:00 PM is <strong>sunset</strong>.  At
    first glance, this seems impossible, but using an advanced interpolation
    algorithm, we can adjust the number of seconds in each minute so that
    there are <strong>exactly</strong> 12 hours of daylight
    <strong>EVERY</strong> day.</p>

  <p> Daylight Local Time is <strong>personalized</strong>, because we use
    state of the art <em>Machine Learning Technology</em> to
    &ldquo;learn&rdquo; YOUR current location.  This location is projected
    onto an <strong>ellipsoid</strong> and fed into formulae devised by
    <strong>international astrophysicists</strong> and used by the
    <strong>NASA</strong>&apos;s Global Positioning Satellite System. From
    these formulae we can compute the <strong>exact</strong> time of sunrise
    and sunset. </p>

  <p> <strong>Internationalization: </strong> This app supports
    internationalization because the clock uses 24 hour time.  If you are
    not a foreigner, this means the time is normal in the morning, but in
    the afternoon you should <strong>subtract 12</strong> from the time.</p>

  <p> <strong>Privacy:</strong> This app uses location information to
    personalize your time zone, but it does not store on a <em>server</em>
    or in the <strong>cloud</strong> this location information or any other
    <strong>personal information</strong>, such as sex, weight, height,
    tooth-to-tattoo ratio or age. If it did, we would delete it right away
    and not look at it. </p>

  <p> <strong>Accessibility:</strong> This app uses a big font for the
    clock, so it should be <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

  <p> <strong>Known Problems: </strong> This app uses a standard ellipsoidal
    model for the <strong>Earth</strong>, so sunrise and sunset might be a
    little off if you are a coal <strong>miner</strong> or climbing a
    <strong>big</strong> mountain or <strong>flying</strong> in a plane or
    something. Also, it is for Earth only, and only runs on
    <strong>Android</strong>. If you have an iPhone or a <em>Blackberry</em>
    phone, or you live on another planet, like <strong>Pluto</strong>, then
    this app won&apos;t work.  If you are from another planet, but visiting
    <strong>Earth</strong>, it should work.  Welcome!  Have a fun time, but
    please don&apos;t mutilate any cows.  </p>

  <p> <strong>Unknown Problems: </strong> The beta testers found some
    problems, but I lost the piece of paper that I wrote them on, so they
    aren&apos;t really known anymore.  If you find any problems, let me
    know.</p>
